firstly just a project to practise my skills, but i found it useful so i just
used it as a search engine.
secondly i attended the web designing class.
thirdly it is the first project of mine that is web-based.

5
i used sqlite for database simply because it was easy. flask is also easy.
and hosting python apps on pythonanywhere is also easy, so you can see that the
design decisions are all made for simplicity.

7
during the school trip i finished the web spider, that should be the only appearance
of the term "school trip".

8
then the ranking algorithm. i chose pagerank, which is based on finding the
website that is linked to the most.

11
then the ui. just four pictures to see...

12
because the simplicity i just couldn't get it to run fast...

13
the web spider is just a 1-day product and was changed a lot during production.

time left?
yes ->
    details of pagerank
no  ->
    just end it and blame at ivy
